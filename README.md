# concrete-compressive
The compressive strength of concrete is determined in batching plant laboratories for every batch in order to maintain the desired quality of concrete during casting. The strength of concrete is required to calculate the strength of the members. Concrete specimens are a cast and tested under the action of compressive loads to determine the strength of concrete.

In very simple words, compressive strength is calculated by dividing the failure load with the area of application of load, usually after 28 days of curing.
